# Memory-Simulator
*Must run with command line argument: "best" or "worst"
This program is a memory simulator. It has a simple interface that allows you to add programs to a 32 "page" memory (where each page represents 4KB of data). You can add data to the program, "kill" running programs, view fragmentation data, and visualize the memory space. Depending on the command line argument, the memory will be filled either using best or worst fit management.
The memory pages are created through the use of linked lists. See the comments for more technical detail.
